1. Computer memory and storage
MEMORY:
RAM random access memory: stores data temporarily. Volatile.
ROM read-only memory: retains data even powers off. Stores firmware and BIOS(basic input/output system).

- SRAM Static Random Access Memory(Fast / Expensive, using CPU memory quick access time)
- DRAM Dynamic Random Access Memory(Slower/ cheaper, constantly refresh)  DDR4 DDR5 GDDR6 massive parallel processing.

- Firmawre is software controls hardware devices communicates.
_ BIOS(basic input/output system) first software computer run, initializing hardware componnets.

STORAGE:
HDD Hard Disk Drive: large storage capacities at low price
SDD Solid state Drive: NAND base flash memory, faster data access
