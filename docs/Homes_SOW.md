1. Develop a user-friendly web application for real estate management.
2. Allow users to view, add, update, and delete house listings.
3. Implement search functionality based on house type, pricing, and location.
4. Ensure a secure and scalable system architecture.

## Scope of Work

The scope of work includes, but is not limited to:

1. Design and development of a Spring Boot application with the following components:
    - HouseController for handling HTTP requests related to houses.
    - HouseService for implementing business logic and interacting with the MongoDB repository.
    - HouseRepository for handling database operations.

2. Implementation of the MongoDB database to store house information:
    - Define the structure of the house document, including fields like id, type, pictureUrl, pricing, and location.

3. Integration with external services if required (e.g., mapping services for geolocation features).

1. Web application with a user-friendly interface for real estate management.
2. Spring Boot application codebase.
3. MongoDB database populated with house information.
4. API documentation outlining available endpoints and functionalities.
5. Test reports ensuring the system's reliability and correctness.
